I am a fourth-year physics PhD student at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, where my advisor is [Ananda Roy](https://sites.rutgers.edu/ananda-roy/). Before this I was at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune and Australian National University (ANU). I work primarily on two dimensional conformal field theory and its interplay with maths and condensed matter physics. You can also find my publications on [Inspire](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2718620).
