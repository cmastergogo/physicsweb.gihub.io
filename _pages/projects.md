<h2>  Lattice Realization of Topological Defects in 2D CFT </h2>

In this project, we work on defining operators on spin chains, such as Transverse Field Ising and Three-State Potts, and more generally on Anyonic chain or Restricted Solid-on-solid (RSOS) Models, which realize topological line operators in the 2D CFT, as we take the continuum limit. 
My collaborators in this project include Ananda Roy, Fei Yan, Hubert Saleur, Linnea Grans-Samuelsson and Thiago Silva Tavares. 

<h2>  Vertex Operator Algebras and Modular Tensor Categories for Narain CFTs </h2>

In this project, we define Non-Chiral Vertex Operator Algebras (VOAs). An example of these are Lorentzian Lattice VOAs (LLVOAs), which along with its modules is called Lorentzian Lattice CFTs (LLCFTs). Narain CFTs are examples of LLCFTs. We also study the Modular Tensor Category underlying Rational LLCFTs. My collaborators in this project include Ranveer Kumar Singh and Runkai Tao.
